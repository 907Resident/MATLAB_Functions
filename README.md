# MATLAB_Functions
Repository of useful functions created for MATLAB users

I started using MATLAB in college (2013) and over the years I have developed several functions that I have found to be useful in my geoscience and environmental engineering research.  This repository will be updated every so often to include more functions as I have time to add them after performing quality control for their functionality.  

The errors should be infomative but please feel free to message me if they do not make sense.
